# Path-Finder
PathFinder is a Java application that recursively searches for a specific file within a given folder and its subdirectories. The program takes two command-line arguments: the folder path to search in and the name (or part of the name) of the file to find. It uses recursive logic to explore subdirectories and outputs the absolute path of any matching files found.

## How it Works
The program accepts two command-line arguments:
1. The path to the folder where the search will begin.
2. The name (or part of the name) of the file you're looking for.

The program will then recursively explore all subdirectories of the given folder. If a file matches the name provided, the program prints the absolute path of the file.
